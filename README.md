# Company Profile

The term “location, location, location” termed by many in the real estate market has turned into a more relevant statement then could possibly have been thought. A significant majority of people turn to online mapping applications as their first choice of understanding a new location while traveling or seeking a specific business or address. However, a significant amount of data is off by many metres or even kilometres.  Essentially, if you are not on a map then you risk insignificance and isolation losing significant revenue every year. Every business and development needs to be geo-referenced for future customers to find. In Canada at least 60% of postal codes do not match up with the locations of houses on Google maps. Some cities do not have up to date data to support new developments and businesses. AddXY can change this situation by ensuring that locational data is current and relevant with mapping giants such as Bing, Google, ESRI and ArcGIS (add the companies you want). 

AddXY is a company founded by Denis Carriere, an entrepreneur and professional geomatics technician with the Government of Canada. Denis feels passionately about the accuracy of GIS data and feels there is no reason, in this day for data to be either missing or incorrect. On the entrepreneurial side he understands intimately, through his own studies and experiences the significance of locational data accuracy for business success and how it will play a key role in future markets.  

AddXY is a GIS specialized organization that maps newly developed residential and commercial buildings for real estate companies and businesses. They will work directly with local municipalities, developers and businesses to identify and explore GIS issues with new and planned developments and businesses. Through vigorously developed networks and specialized GIS software tools AddXY will then ensure that current and relevant locational data is incorporated into the most popular open source mapping applications such as;

- Google maps
- Bing
- TomTom
- Apple maps
- MapQuest
- Nokia
